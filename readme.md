# Agent Resources

Repository of personal agent resources (skills, defaults, and helper scripts) used to configure AI coding agents.

- `default.md`: shared base instructions for agents.
- `skills/`: reusable skill definitions and supporting files.
- `sync.sh`: syncs `default.md` to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, and copies `skills/` into both tools' `skills/` directories.
